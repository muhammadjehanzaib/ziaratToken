# Ziarat Token Contract Documentation
### Overview

The Ziarat Token (ZIAR) is an ERC20-based token with added governance and vesting functionalities. This documentation provides an overview of the contractâ€™s features and explains how developers can test the contract using Foundry or other testing frameworks.

### Features
#### 1. Token Details
* Symbol: ZIAR

* Decimals: 18 (default for ERC20)

* Max Supply: 1,000,000,000 tokens

#### 2. Governance 
The token includes a governance system that allows users to:
